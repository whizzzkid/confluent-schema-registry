In version 1, `@kafkajs/confluent-schema-registry` only supported Avro schemas and
the API was very Avro specific. In version 2, support for JSON Schema and Protobuf
was added, which necessitated some changes in the public api.

We have tried to make these changes as unintrusive as we can, by making the vast
majority of changes backwards compatible. In fact, for Javascript users, the changes
are completely backwards compatible for Avro schemas.

For Typescript users, however, or if you are migrating from using Avro to using
one of the other schema types, there are a few things to keep in mind.

The main change is that the core `Schema` type has changed from an Avro specific
schema to a generic schema interface for all schema types. The old schema looked
like this:

```ts
interface AvroSchema {
  name: string
  namespace?: string
  type: 'record'
  fields: any[]
  toBuffer(payload: object): Buffer
  fromBuffer(buffer: Buffer, resolver?: Resolver, noCheck?: boolean): any
  isValid(
    payload: object,
    opts?: { errorHook: (path: Array<string>, value: any, type?: any) => void },
  ): boolean
}
```

This is still the case for Avro schemas, but for Protobuf or Json Schema, a
more generic schema type is used:

```ts
interface Schema {
  toBuffer(payload: object): Buffer
  fromBuffer(buffer: Buffer, resolver?: Resolver, noCheck?: boolean): any
  isValid(
    payload: object,
    opts?: { errorHook: (path: Array<string>, value: any, type?: any) => void },
  ): boolean
}
```

If you have code that uses any of the Avro specific fields on the schema
(for example returned by `getSchema`), you may need to first narrow the type
to `AvroSchema`:

```ts
import { AvroSchema, Schema } from '@kafkajs/confluent-schema-registry'

function isAvroSchema(schema: AvroSchema | Schema): schema is AvroSchema {
  return (schema as AvroSchema).name != null
}

const schema = await registry.getSchema(registryId)

if (isAvroSchema(schema)) {
  // schema is now `AvroSchema`
  const { name, namespace, type, fields } = schema
}
```

## Adapting to new APIs

This is **entirely optional**, as all the old APIs should be retained (with the above caveat
about the schema type), but if you want to adapt your code to the new API to make
future migrations easier, these are the changes you would need to make.

### Configuring serialization libraries

In version 1, the client constructor took a second `options` argument with
a single option `forSchemaOptions` that was passed directly to
[`avsc.Type.forSchema`](https://github.com/mtth/avsc/wiki/API#typeforschemaschema-opts)
as the `opts` argument.

```js
const { SchemaRegistry } = require('@kafkajs/confluent-schema-registry')

const registry = new SchemaRegistry(
  { host: 'http://localhost:8081' },
  { forSchemaOptions: { noAnonymousTypes: true }}
)
```

Since we now support multiple schema types, these options have been moved
one level into a schema type specific option without the `forSchemaOptions`
key:

```js
const { SchemaRegistry, SchemaType } = require('@kafkajs/confluent-schema-registry')

const registry = new SchemaRegistry(
  { host: 'http://localhost:8081' },
  {
    [SchemaType.AVRO]: { noAnonymousTypes: true },
    
    // This allows you to also pass options for Protobuf and JSON Schema
    [SchemaType.JSON]: { strict: true }

    [SchemaType.PROTOBUF]: { messageName: 'CustomMessage' }
  }
)
```

See [Schema Type Options](./usage#schema-type-options) for more information.

### Registering schemas

In version 1, the schema type was implicitly Avro, so you would just pass in the
schema from `readAVSCAsync` directly:

```js
const schema = await readAVSCAsync('path/to/schema.avsc')
await registry.register(schema)
```

In version 2, there are two major changes:

1. The `type` of the schema needs to be set to one of `SchemaType`.
2. The `schema` itself is now a string, instead of an object.

We call this new type a `ConfluentSchema`

```ts
interface ConfluentSchema {
  type: SchemaType
  schema: string
}
```

```js
const { SchemaType } = require('@kafkajs/confluent-schema-registry')

const schema = await readAVSCAsync('path/to/schema.avsc')
const schemaString = JSON.stringify(schema)
await registry.register({ type: SchemaType.AVRO, schema: schemaString })
```

### Getting registry id by schema

Similar to `register`, getting the registry id by schema used to take an
`AvroSchema`, and now takes a `ConfluentSchema`.

Version 1:

```js
const schema = await readAVSCAsync('path/to/schema.avsc')
await registry.getRegistryIdBySchema('subject', schema)
```

Version 2:

```js
const schema = await readAVSCAsync('path/to/schema.avsc')
const schemaString = JSON.stringify(schema)
await registry.getRegistryIdBySchema('subject', { type: SchemaType.AVRO, schema: schemaString })
```
